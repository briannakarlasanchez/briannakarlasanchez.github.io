<figure>This documentary focuses on how the learning institution, Fordham University, tackles the pressing issue of mental health amongst college students. College students are under immense pressure having to balance the substantial workload that comes with college and any private matters in their personal lives. Fordham’s Mental Health aims to shed light on how much of a toll this all can be on students and effective mental health services can be for students. My partner, Aditi Praveen Kariyanahalli, and I gathered students, Avery Loftis and Vanessa Albert, who have sought out help from Fordham’s Counseling & Psychological (C.P.S.) Department. In their interviews, they share whether the college’s mental health services were helpful and if their experiences were positive or negative. Aside from our student participants, we also talked to the director of C.P.S., Dr. Jeffrey Ng, who spoke of all the resources the university provides for students and his thoughts on the state of mental health at Fordham. This documentary explores Fordham’s Lincoln Center Campus in Manhattan, New York, including a few sequences of student life. There are also brief scenes of Fordham’s C.P.S. Department where we see the office’s waiting room and overall environment that greets students when they enter. This documentary was made to raise awareness of college students’ mental health and illustrate how it is an issue that needs to be tended to. Check it out and please enjoy!

    <figcaption>Here is a photo, titled "Fordham and the Intersection of Student Mental Health". What is shown is a book shelf consisting of several self-help books that are centered around counseling. My documentary centers around student self-care and counseling for college students. This bookshelf display is located in the Loweinstein Building of Fordham's Lincoln Center Campus.</figcaption> <link rel="stylesheet" href="intersection of mental health caption.css">

        <figcaption>This photo is called "College Students are Distressed". This picture is meant to symbolize the active life of college students and how hectic it is, always coming in and out of classes, never really having a chance to take a break. Included in the photo is a statistic that over half of college students have reported feeling unwell mentally. This statistic, alone, shows how this is an issue that needs affirmative action.</figcaption>
